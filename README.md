1. Key differences between RPC types:
- **Unary RPC**: Seen in `ProcessPayment` - single request/response, ideal for simple operations
- **Server Streaming**: Used in `GetTransactionHistory` - streams multiple responses, good for paginated data
- **Bi-directional Streaming**: Implemented in `Chat` - continuous two-way communication, perfect for real-time chat

2. Security considerations:
- Current implementation lacks TLS/SSL encryption
- No authentication middleware
- Could implement using tonic's transport layer security
- Should add request validation
- Need to implement proper error handling

3. Bidirectional streaming challenges:
- Resource management (seen in `MyChatService`)
- Error handling for disconnections
- Message ordering
- Back-pressure handling
- Channel capacity management (current channel size of 10 may need tuning)

4. ReceiverStream advantages/disadvantages:
Advantages:
- Clean integration with Tokio async runtime
- Built-in backpressure handling
- Type-safe message passing

Disadvantages:
- Memory overhead for channel buffers
- Potential blocking if channel capacity is reached
- Complex error handling needed

5. Code structure improvements:
- Separate services into modules
- Create shared data models
- Extract business logic from service implementations
- Add middleware layer
- Implement proper error types
- Use dependency injection

6. MyPaymentService improvements:
```
#[tonic::async_trait]
impl PaymentService for MyPaymentService {
    async fn process_payment(
        &self,
        request: Request<PaymentRequest>,
    ) -> Result<Response<PaymentResponse>, Status> {
        // Add validation
        // Implement transaction handling
        // Add payment gateway integration
        // Include error handling
        // Add logging
        // Implement retries
        // Add metrics
    }
}
```

7. gRPC architectural impact:
- Strong contract through Protocol Buffers
- Better performance than REST
- Language-agnostic communication
- Built-in streaming support
- Code generation reduces errors
- Requires HTTP/2 support

8. HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1:
- Multiplexing support
- Header compression
- Binary protocol vs text-based
- Stream prioritization
- Server push capability
- Better performance

9. gRPC vs REST streaming:
- gRPC has native bi-directional streaming
- Lower latency in gRPC
- Better resource utilization
- Built-in flow control
- Type safety through protobuf

10. Protocol Buffers vs JSON:
- Stricter schema validation
- Better performance
- Smaller payload size
- Code generation
- Better type safety
- Less flexible than JSON
- Harder to debug (binary format)
